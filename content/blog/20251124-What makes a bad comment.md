Capturing a conversation between myself and one of my friends about over
commenting in code bases.

One of my key arguments for good comments is intention. It's most important
that each comment in code be intentionally placed so that they don't become
additional noise.

Unfortunately, there's no right answer in how to write comments such that
they are not overcommenting (as the rules may vary by team and need), but
rather, I think it can be nice to have some examples of what I consider
"useless comments".

## Useless Comment #1 - Committing Commented Out Code

Outside of specific build by build debugging (though please, just use a
debugger or improve your logging), comments that leave a bunch of additional
loose code should just generally not be something that is strewn about the
codebase. Few things are more distracting than having to skip through vast
swathes of a function just to find what you are looking for.

## Useless Comment #2 - Rephrasing a Function or Package

This should be relatively obvious, but there's no reason to comment `Reverses
the datatype` for a reverse function _unless_ there is something novel about
it that warrants it.

For example the difference between the following:

```
// Sorts the slice
func sort(a []Type) {
    ...
}
```

vs:

```
// Implements an in place quicksort algorithm with no additional memory
// allocations
func sort(a []Type) {
    ...
}
```

## Useless Comment #3 - Explaining the Syntax

The less obvious, but still wasteful comments are comments that explain
syntax. Consider the following golang snippet:

```go
// Iterates through the slice
for i := range len(connections) {
    // if the element is currently closed, prune
    if connections[i].IsDisconnected() {
        // close
        close(connections[i])
    }
}
```

For inexperienced or non-technical readers, these comments may be welcome. The
main issue is that, for _most_ code bases, people should be able to understand
what happens from the syntax alone.

Much more useful would be explaining _why_ we are iterating through our
connections.

Unless you are aiming at educating users on the syntax of a language, this
is typically unnecessary bloat to the code base (and let's be honest, the
target audience for most comments are yourself).

### A Better Approach

Something like the following would be more useful in order to outline the
intent of why the connections are being iterated:

```go
// This is to ensure periodic cleanup of connections that have previously
// been closed
for i := range len(connections) {
    // Due to the way that connections
    if connections[i].IsDisconnected() {
        // close and prune the associated listener
        close(connections[i])
    }
}
```

## The Takeaway

Remember, comments code syntax self documents _what is happening_ but doesn't
document the intent of the code. Documenting the intent is the difference
between immediately understanding why a conclusion has been reached and
having to reinvent it only to end up with the same solution.
