So, most of my experience is in the weeds of programming. Not nearly as much
is in styling and CSS, but have been attempting to learn lately.

## The State of CSS

Interestingly enough, CSS is still a similar beast to what it has been since
the dawn of styling on the internet, where general layouts are relatively
simple to implement using semantic HTML, but specialized widgets can be a
nightmare of complexity.

When I first studied this in the early 2010s, it was convention to use classes
to layout specific components, possibly extending to use multiple CSS and
SASS files to lay everything out, but utility frameworks have been on the rise.

## The Utility Class Debate

Now there is also a competing idea of Utility-class frameworks which --
in my opinion -- is probably the best way to do complex CSS. While the
"external CSS file" is often very clean and pretty:

```html
<div class="mystyle" id="mydiv"></div>
```

The challenge is that often trying to mix styles is difficult with conflicting
meanings. `mystyle` could have any number of CSS and could apply to any
number of different types of styles with any number of additional effects.

This makes it harder to know what exactly is going on with any given style.

## Enter Tailwind

Utility-class frameworks like `tailwindcss` solve this by heavily leaning into
composition so your classes would look like something similar to:

```html
<div class="container flex bg-gray-50 mx-8 px-8"></div>
```

As can be seen in the above, it's inline with the div, it defines that it is
a flex container with the color gray-50 with margins and padding. It does get
uglier and much more verbose as you go which clutters the markup. This is a
fact, and it is a major point of contention among critics that has a lot of
merit (as can be seen by the excessive number of component libraries out there
like tailwindplus, daisyui, shadcn, basecoat, templui, etc). The verbosity
also can lead to quite the learning curve (e.g. the Rust of CSS if you will)
as you cannot simply look at the class and get a general understanding of
what it does, you need to _know_ it or it is utterly incomprehensible.

While valid, I honestly can't think of a better idea for the complex web
applications. There is an incredible amount that can go into styling web
applications with very specific requirements and a class based approach like
the [csszengarden](https://csszengarden.com/) is very difficult to scale
cleanly _anyways_. There is the added challenge that updating or altering
individual components can affect other components in separate areas of the
site. As a result, utility classes manage to overcome this by moving all
the complexity out into the markup instead of hiding it away.

## The Classless CSS Movement

Actually, speaking of the csszengarden, there has also been a minimalist
movement gaining traction with the appearance of classless CSS libraries
aimed at adding styling based (almost) exclusively on semantic HTML. This
site uses one such framework [picocss](https://picocss.com/) exclusively
because it is _dead simple_. I imagine that most webapps should aggressively
attempt to use a classless CSS framework (either found online or made on
their own) as long as possible before adding tailwind. Tailwind seems to
still make excessive use of `<div>` when modern HTML has so many better
ways to define the type of content in the tags like `<header>`, `<main>`,
`<section>`, etc that minimalism should be embraced before complexity arrives.

## Conclusion

That being said, I think there's some application ideas that I want to try
where tailwind would be quite useful. Will see if I can try that later.
