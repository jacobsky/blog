Recently I have spent a fair bit of time with `opencode` over the past few
days experimenting and trying to fit it into my neovim development workflow.

[`opencode`](opencode.ai) is an opensource coding agent aimed at running AI
agents via the commandline and is compatible with all kinds of coding agents
both hosted online and hosted locally.

While I have historically not had great experiences with AI agents, but
I continue to hear about how important it is to have Agentic AI in your
workflows so I figured I'd give it another shake. Maybe the previous ones
that I used were just bad.

## Why `opencode`?

`opencode` fit the bill for a few reasons:

- Installable via the Arch (btw) User Repository `yay -Sy opencode-bin`
- [`opencode.nvim`](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim) fits into
  an nvim workflow
- Terminal oriented
- Relatively fast
- Model and vendor agnostic (I should probably write my thoughts about
  why almost everyone should avoid vendor locking)
- Potential to support locally hosted models (massive+ because I hate
  being bound to cloud providers who may vanish at a moment's notice)

Upon installing, I picked an older project that I wanted to work on and
spent some time using it's features.

## It's not about the task, it's about the plan

One feature of `opencode` that differentiates it from my last experience with
agentic AI is the difference between planning mode and building mode. Planning
mode puts your LLM in read-only mode (can only index and read files in your
repository) and orients everything around the LLM asking you questions about
the goal to help refine a plan that it can tackle at a later state.

My _first_ attempt at using things I started directly in build mode and
just gave it a simple task like "create unit tests for each module of the
project, do not update any existing code, only create new files" and this
went... exceptionally poorly. The LLM itself basically went around creating
tests and altering changing files willy nilly to make things pass even going
so far as to try to duplicate the work of code generation tools like `sqlc`
that I have been using instead of an ORM.

I _almost_ gave up on the project here, but read a little more into it
and realized that the problem was probably that I didn't use planning mode
prior. Working with planning mode largely resolved this. While the code and
test quality is a _bit dubious at times_ (this could be model specific as I'm
not paying for this), the big thing that changed is that it actually _did_
what I asked. Which was a pretty great improvement.

## Implementation

`opencode` is considerably better at implementing code than when I last
worked with Agentic AI which primarily delivered broken code that I had
to completely audit. Now at least my project would start up and run after
giving the agent a task.

I will say that I was moderately impressed at how well it did build up
scaffolding once I build up an example of what I wanted. I was also impressed
when I was able to take my old project and just task the AI with converting
the `log.Printf` calls to a proper `slog` call. While not all of the logic
was readily apparent, I was able to understand it easily enough while code
reviewing.

This did have the downside of, every time I give the agent a task, I need
to do a code review before committing and moving forward. While `opencode`
comes with a nice `/review` command, there is a bit of a problem with having
an LLM review it's own work. It _might_ pick up on things, but it's still got
the weakness of potentially explaining or judging things wrong so whenever
I use this, I do feel that I'm stuck spending a lot of time just reading
through code. It works, but it's not what I really love doing.

## An Enhanced Rubber Duck

The more I experimented, the more that I found that planning mode was more
of a game changer. Working solo on things, the biggest thing that I struggle
with is reviewing my code. It's not always possible to get a second pair of
eyes on my code or ideas, so I end up spending a fair bit of time searching
around on the internet to look for stuff and trying to digest best practices
for go. One of my favorite things that I have been able to use `opencode`
Being able to say something like "I'd like to write unit tests" I was actually
it was actually a good way to get a first eye on the problem. It functions
a lot like an enhanced rubberduck debugger. Most of the time, I'm basically
muttering to myself or a cat to think through a problem anyways, so being
able to yeet out some questions or thoughts into the void _and actually get
an answer_ can be helpful.

It's also less burdensome than code since, there's no testing or maintenance
required afterwards. In this way, I'm actually really convinced that AI
reviewing should be a major part of my workflow. When an Agent reviews
my current commit and gives me some wrong information like "`time.Ticker`
does not always call `Ticker.Stop()` and is a major memory leak" forcing me
to prove my assumptions by digging into the actual library code to find the
comment "Since go 1.23 the garbage collector can now collect unreferenced
timers even when they are not stopped" was a _major learning point_ that
forced me to validate my understanding.

This is amazing and exactly what I need as someone that primarily works solo.

## It's not all perfect

While it was exceedingly better than my prior experiences (i.e. I am now
moved from a clear "I hate AI" position to more of a "I don't love it,
but it might be useful" position), I've still got some major concerns.

### Loss of Ownership

My first major issue is that I feel zero sense of ownership or satisfaction
from the code produced by the agent. This means that I dread committing the
work more than when I'm actually working on the project myself. No context,
no understanding, no feeling of desire to improve it or change it. It's
just code that exists and I feel the possible maintenance burden (i.e. I
still very much dislike the agents going off and coding stuff.) It gives me
a feeling of apathy towards improving the codebase or trying to find good
abstractions to work with as the AI can just kind of write a bunch of code
_anyways_. I feel like a passenger just attempting to point an unlearning
student driver in the vaguely correct direction instead of working as a
technical leader who is actively participating in the process.

### The Learning Problem

I also learned nothing about golang while using the agent for actually
programming. Even in the code reviews, while I remember reading through the
diffs and checking the code compiled, I don't really remember anything specific
that it generated. The closest being that it logged certain status codes 400
or higher as `slog.Error` instead of `slog.Info` which I only remember because
I thought "Well, really we should only log them as an error when they are
500 or above" for metrics purposes. The closest thing to knowledge was that
I was able to reinforce what I had learned, but not really learning new things.

Much of this concern for learning comes from first hand experience in a
different domain, second language learning (specifically reading/writing). As
I previously worked for an AI company that, not only allowed, but encouraged
the heavy use of AI tools in our workflows, my skills in Japanese largely
stagnated and atrophied during my tenure at that company. This is because
learning to read takes time and effort and using AI is _fast_. The AI
translation and writing tools do not have to be perfect, they have to be
faster and less effort than doing it manually. This is not a high bar for
someone that is not particularly skilled in the language. Given how fast
companies want to move, this temptation grows with every single task. And
the temptation never goes away.

### The Mental Resilience Issue

This experience with language learning is very relevant to the conversation as
programming is much more closely related to linguistics than it is related to
math (though it does borrow heavily from it). Learning programming languages
is very much akin to learning a new context-free language with all the
syntax. Oddly enough, you can relate a lot of programming _to_ regular
language constructs with things like the formal grammar, informal grammar
(native extensions and standard library), dialects (user packages), and
slang (user built shortcuts/functions/macros). The temptations and methods
of learning are very _very_ similar with a lot of overlap.

One major similarity is that AI reduces my mental resilience to being intimidated
by long strings of text (in Japanese). This is not just a second language thing
given the popularity of AI summarization and automatic drafting tool use,
etc. We as humans need a level of mental fortitude in order to look at a
big messy glob of stuff and break it down into things that we can make sense of
and AI reduces this by making through processes compete with "copy paste".

Everything looks like this. When I was a child, the newspaper was an intimidating
sea of text one could get lost in. Today, I know how to parse it into sections
and read only the pieces of information that I am interested in. I had to build
that resilience.

## In Summary: Not great, not terrible

Consider me officially convinced to add it into a workflow, but unconvinced
on the actual code generation. I can see myself using AI for really
boring stuff like scaffolding (once I figure out a good agentic prompt
to scaffold my projects in a way that _I_ like consistently); converting
between logging solutions across a project (like a better grep/find replace);
as a reviewer for my commits and work; and finally hyper specific function
level implementations for specific flows that I find exceptionally tedious
an uninteresting (i.e. JWT authorization, writing specific test cases, etc).

I plan to generally avoid it for doing more than that. I don't plan to use it
for asking questions about the code base itself and really only plan to ask
it when I would normally turn to google because the included documentation
isn't sufficient.

Thank you `opencode` team for making an actually usable agent service.
